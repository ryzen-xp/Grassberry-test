Blockchain Problem Statement:
At Grassberry, we aim to use blockchain technology to create transparency and accountability in transactions between users, organizations, and merchants.

Question:1 (ans - Que 1 )
Imagine a user initiates a purchase on a platform that connects them to a merchant. You are tasked with designing a blockchain-based system to track and verify the transaction across multiple stages, ensuring transparency without compromising user privacy.

Example Scenario:
A user attempts to purchase a product, and the transaction must pass through several stages such as payment approval, merchant confirmation, and potential issues like declined payments or cancellations. Each step needs to be verifiable, yet no sensitive information should be exposed.

Hints:

1.Consider how smart contracts might handle each stage of the transaction.
2.Think about how the system can log both successful and failed transactions transparently.
3.Explore methods to ensure user privacy and security while maintaining transparency.

Question:2 (ans - question -2)

Explain your approach, focusing on the blockchain structure, failure handling, and how privacy is maintained throughout the process.
