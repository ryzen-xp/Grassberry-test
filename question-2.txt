Overview of the PaymentManager Smart Contract
1. Blockchain Structure: The PaymentManager smart contract manages payment  transactions between users and merchants on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses a structured format to define transaction states (e.g., Initiated, Completed) and stores transaction details in a mapping for easy retrieval. Events are emitted for real-time updates on transaction status.

2. Failure Handling: The contract includes safety checks using require statements to prevent incorrect actions. If a transaction encounters issues, it reverts to maintain stability. Users can also open disputes if problems arise after a product is shipped, allowing for conflict resolution.

3. Privacy Protection: User identities are kept private through Ethereum    addresses, which are pseudonymous. The contract only stores necessary information, minimizing data exposure. Access modifiers ensure that only authorized users can interact with their transactions, enhancing privacy further.

Conclusion :-
The PaymentManager smart contract efficiently facilitates secure transactions, handles errors, and protects user privacy, making it a reliable solution for payment management on the blockchain.
